# Hybrid_features_codes
Codes for  Statistical and Wavelets Features.
The feature extraction code is written in MATLAB while the classification is performed in WEKA Machine Learning toolkit.

The attached files contains all the source codes for feature extraction along with validation and training/testing datasets.

The files also contains the Weka Experimenter models used for expiremental results based on the BraTS, AANLIB and PIMS MRI datasets.

1. Mean   2. Varaince 3. Skewness 4. Kurtosis 5. Energy 6. Entropy
   Second Order Feature based on Co-occurance matrix   %%%%
 7. Angular second Moment 8.Correlation  9.Inertia 10.Absolte Value
 11.Inverse Difference 12 .Entropy  13.Maximum Probability
